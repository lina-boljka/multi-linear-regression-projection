This folder includes the data and code used for producing multilinear regression based statistical projections in Omrani et al 2022 [doi:NPJCLIMATSCI-00698]. 

File "AMO_etc_projection.ipynb" is a notebook with the code and additional detailed text & instructions on how to use it.
Folders "txts" and "nc" include detrended timeseries and their trends, respectively. 

The code can be run for different parameters used in Omrani et al 2022 as well as some additional ones (like northern and southern European precipitation). The code typically uses multi-linear projection to predict specific variable's future timeseries from 4 variables: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), sea ice, and the variable itself. For details see the manuscript or notebook itself.

File "AMO_etc_projection.ipynb" shows one example of using this code (for projecting AMO into the future).

Navigate to: https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/lina-boljka-mul-sion-projection-8x08xrat/lab/tree/Omrani_etal2022 to find interactive version of the provided Notebook, where parameters can be changed to see results/projections for different variables.
