# multi-linear-regression-projection
Code for multilinear regression used as a statistical projection of various variables based on indices related to Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and related physics. For details see Omrani et al. 2022 [doi:NPJCLIMATSCI-00698].

This repository for now includes only the code used for Omrani et al 2022 - their multi-linear regression statistical projection. The code has been prepared in a Jupyter notebook in the folder "Omrani_etal2022" called "AMO_etc_projection.ipynb". The data necessary to run the script are provided in folders "txts" and "nc" next to the notebook. See README-file in the Omrani_etal2022 folder for further instructions.
