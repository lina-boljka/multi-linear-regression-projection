# multi-linear-regression-projection
Code for multilinear regression used as a statistical projection of various variables based on indices related to Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and related physics. For details see Omrani et al. 2022.

This repository for now includes only the code used for Omrani et al 2022 - their multi-linear regression statistical projection. The code has been prepared in a Jupyter notebook in the folder "Omrani_etal2022" called "AMO_etc_projection.ipynb". The data necessary to run the script are provided in folders "txts" and "nc" next to the notebook. 

The code can be run for different parameters used in Omrani et al 2022 as well as some additional ones (like northern and southern European precipitation). The code typically uses multi-linear projection to predict specific variable's future timeseries from 4 variables: North Atlantic Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, sea ice, and the variable itself. For details see the manuscript or notebook itself.
