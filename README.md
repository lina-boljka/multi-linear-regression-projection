# multi-linear-regression-projection
Code for multilinear regression used as a statistical projection of various variables based on indices related to Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and related physics. For details see Omrani et al. 2022 [doi:NPJCLIMATSCI-00698].

This repository for now includes only the code used for Omrani et al 2022 - their multi-linear regression statistical projection. The code has been prepared in a Jupyter notebook (called "AMO_etc_projection.ipynb") and is stored in the folder "Omrani_etal2022". The data necessary to run the script are provided in folders "txts" and "nc" next to the notebook. Python environment necessary to run the script is prvided in environment.yml. See README-file in the Omrani_etal2022 folder for further instructions. 

Interactive versions of notebooks from this repository can be accessed <a href="https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/lina-boljka-mul-sion-projection-8x08xrat/lab"> HERE</a>. The folder structure is the same as in this GitHub repository.
* Here Notebooks can be amended and different parameters analysed/plotted!! 
* USE THIS LINK IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE PARAMETERS IN THE NOTEBOOK!!!
